  ### Introduction to HTML
  1.	HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
  2.	Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
  3.	HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
  4.	Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.
  5.	Headings and sub-headings, ``<h1>`` to ``<h6>`` tags, are used to enlarge text.
  6.	``<p>``, ``<span>`` and ``<div>`` tags specify text or blocks.
  7.	The ``<em>`` and ``<strong>`` tags are used to emphasize text.
  8.	Line breaks are created with the ``<br>`` tag.
  9.	Ordered lists ``<ol>`` are numbered and unordered lists ``<ul>`` are bulleted.
  10.	Images ``<img>`` and videos ``<video>`` can be added by linking to an existing source.
  
  ### HTML Document Standards
  1.	The ``<!DOCTYPE html>`` declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.
  2.	The ``<html>`` element will contain all of your HTML code.
  3.	Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the ``<head>`` of the page.
  4.	You can add a title to your web page by using the ``<title>`` element, inside of the head.
  5.	A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.
  6.	Anchor tags ``<a>`` are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
  7.	You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using ``<a>`` tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
  8.	Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
  9.	Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
  10.	Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.
  
## HTML Tables
__Learned how to create a table, add data to it, and section the table into smaller parts that make it easier to read.__

  ### Tasks:
  - [x] Created a simple webpage about [Shipping Table](https://github.com/kai-ion/Learn-HTML-CodeAcademy/tree/master/Shipping%20Table).

  - [ ] Created a Wine Festival Schedule

  ### Tables
  1.	The ``<table>`` element creates a table.
  2.	The ``<tr>`` element adds rows to a table.
  3.	To add data to a row, you can use the ``<td>`` element.
  4.	Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the ``<th>`` element.
  5.	Table data can span columns using the ``colspan`` attribute.
  6.	Table data can span rows using the ``rowspan`` attribute.
  7.	Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer.
  8.	A table’s head is created with the ``<thead>`` element.
  9.	A table’s body is created with the ``<tbody>`` element.
  10.	A table’s footer is created with the ``<tfoot>`` element.
  11.	All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be applied to tables and their data.
