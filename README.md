  ### Introduction to HTML
  - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
  - Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
  - HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
  - Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.
  - Headings and sub-headings, ``<h1>`` to ``<h6>`` tags, are used to enlarge text.
  - ``<p>``, ``<span>`` and ``<div>`` tags specify text or blocks.
  - The ``<em>`` and ``<strong>`` tags are used to emphasize text.
  - Line breaks are created with the ``<br>`` tag.
  - Ordered lists (``<ol>``) are numbered and unordered lists (``<ul>``) are bulleted.
  - Images (``<img>``) and videos (``<video>``) can be added by linking to an existing source.
  
  ### HTML Document Standards
  - The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.
  - The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
  - Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
  - You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
  - A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.
  - Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
  - You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
  - Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
  - Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
  - Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.

  ### Tables
  •	The <table> element creates a table.
  •	The <tr> element adds rows to a table.
  •	To add data to a row, you can use the <td> element.
  •	Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the <th> element.
  •	Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute.
  •	Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute.
  •	Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer.
  •	A table’s head is created with the <thead> element.
  •	A table’s body is created with the <tbody> element.
  •	A table’s footer is created with the <tfoot> element.
  •	All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be applied to tables and their data.
