My Progress On learning HTML from CodeAcademy


## Elements and Structure
__Learn about HTML elements and structure, the building blocks of websites.__

Created a simple webpage about [Brown Bears](https://github.com/kai-ion/Learn-HTML-CodeAcademy/tree/master/Brown%20Bears)

A preview can be seen [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kai-ion/Learn-HTML-CodeAcademy/blob/master/Brown%20Bears/index.html)
  ### 1. Introduction to HTML
  - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
  - Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
  - HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
  - Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.
  - Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.
  - <p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.
  - The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
  - Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.
  - Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.
  - Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.
  ### 2. HTML Document Standards
  #### Lesson:
  - The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.
  - The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
  - Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
  - You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
  - A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.
  - Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
  - You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
  - Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
  - Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
  - Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.
